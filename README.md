# Howard Bleich Acid Base Disorders

## App Description:
This Streamlit application is designed to implement and streamline the calculation process involved in Howard Bleich's evaluation of Acid-Base disorders. Named the "Howard Bleich's Evaluation of Acid Base Disorders App", it simplifies the task of calculating complex biochemical measurements, leading to faster and more efficient interpretation of laboratory results. This web-based tool is created using Python, and it follows the guidelines and formulas provided by Howard Bleich from Harvard Medical Informatics.

## Intended Usage:
Data Input: The user enters the required biochemical measurements including pH, pCO2, HCO3, Albumin, Na, and Cl. Each parameter has been given a separate input field for ease of usage. The values should be in respective standard units: pH (0-14), pCO2 in mmHg, HCO3 in mEq/L, Albumin in g/dL, Na and Cl in mEq/L.

- Calculation: After the necessary data input, users can click on the 'Calculate' button to process the input and calculate the disorder.

- Output: The application will then provide an output suggesting the acid-base disorder, based on the entered values.

##Guidelines:
- Correct Units: Always make sure to enter the parameters in their respective standard units to ensure accurate results.

- Data Accuracy: The accuracy of the results is highly dependent on the accuracy of the entered data. Therefore, users should double-check the entered parameters for any potential input errors.

- Result Interpretation: The application's output provides a general overview of the acid-base status. It does not replace a comprehensive medical assessment. The results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings for appropriate medical decision-making.

- Data Security: As the application doesn't store any input or output data, users can confidently use the tool without concerns about data privacy.

Please remember that this tool does not serve as a replacement for professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for precise diagnosis and treatment.
